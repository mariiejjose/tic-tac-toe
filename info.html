               This is a Christmas-Themed Tic Tac Toe game, or as most of us Lebanese call it, a game of XO.
			   While most people view this game as a way to pass time in class with their friends (same goes for me), it is actually a fun game and a big part of out childhood.
			   So, seeing as we had a Web Development project, what better thing to present other than a fun and easy game!
			   We hope our fellow classmates and Dr. Hicham like it.
			   <br>Thank you for playing :)<br>
